# Path Visualizer
Delhi Path Visualizer:

A web application that visualizes the shortest path between major locations in Delhi using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
The project provides an interactive map, clear route visualization, and a simple interface for experimenting with graph-based pathfinding.

Features:
Shortest Path Calculation

Select any two locations and the application displays the shortest path along with total distance.




Interactive Visualization:

-Click nodes to set start/end points
-Hover and view distances between connected locations
-Clean canvas-based rendering
-Auto-scaling and auto-centering map for all screen sizes
-Custom Additions


Users can add:

-New locations
-New edges/paths
-Custom distances



Modern UI:

Dark-mode interface designed to be clean, readable, and suitable for presentation or interviews.



Tech Stack:

HTML5 — Structure
CSS3 — Styling and layout
JavaScript — Core logic, Dijkstra’s algorithm, canvas rendering
Canvas API — For visualization
